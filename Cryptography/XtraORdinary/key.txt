In the python code, we can see that it uses 1 secret key firstly, then 5 different random strings to encrypt the flag.
However, we can't directly check out how many times do the random strings used.
But XOR has only do or not do, so we only need to check 32 different cases.
Use python code to brute force the secret key, in sol1.py.
It seems 'Africa!' is the most possible key.
So use it to get the flag. In sol.py
