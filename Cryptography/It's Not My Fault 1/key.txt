It need to firstly enter a string which meets its regulation. We can brute force to find it.
And then we can notice that it's p is restricted in 2^20. ed≡1(mod p-1) and Fermat's little theorem, We can get r^(ed)≡r(mod p)
So r^(ed)-r=kp, and if we choose a number r from (1,N), it has a high possibility to get p=gcd(r^(ed)-r,N)=gcd((r^(ed)-r) mod N,N)
Use this outcome to brute force and get the flag. In sol.py.
