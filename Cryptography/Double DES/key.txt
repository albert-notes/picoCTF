It's a DES question, and it encrypt it twice to make it more complex(?).
But because it only encrypted twice, so we can use Meet-In-The-Middle attack.
It's key length is only 6 bytes(HINT), so brute force is easy.
We can check if the middle message is the same, to check if the number is the key.
Use python to solve it. In sol.py.
Get the flag.
