Open IDA Pro and open the file.
We can get into main function and see that there's executing 3 functions.
call    sub_1D7C
call    sub_298A
call    sub_1D52
Get into sub_298A, and it seems like it's calling the flag.
But at the head is waiting for a very long time.
So we can patch it to 0 and execute it to get the flag.
Before patch: 0x38D7EA4C68000
After patch: 0x0
