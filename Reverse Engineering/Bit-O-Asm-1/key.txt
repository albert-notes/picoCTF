Take a look on the txt file.

<+0>:     endbr64
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi
<+15>:    mov    eax,0x30
<+20>:    pop    rbp
<+21>:    ret

Obviously, the final value of eax is 0x30, so the flag is picoCTF{48}.
