Also take a look on the txt.

<+0>:     endbr64
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+25>:    pop    rbp
<+26>:    ret

The DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4] was assigned with the value 0x9fe1a, and next the eax was assigned with the value of DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4].
So the final value of eax is 0x9fe1a, so the flag is picoCTF{654874}.
