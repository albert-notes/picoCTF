This problem is different from other problems above.
It need to get four bytes of eax, so use gdb to run.
Use 'ni' until the command with eax.

â–º 0x40111c       <main+22>                       mov    eax, dword ptr [rbp - 4]      <main>

Then use its hint, type x/4xb $eax

pwndbg> x/4xb $eax
0x401106 <main>:        0xf3    0x0f    0x1e    0xfa

According to its description, the flag is picoCTF{0xf3f1efa}.
