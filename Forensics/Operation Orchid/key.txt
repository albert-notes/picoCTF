Enter the root file by fls and we can notice that there's a flag.txt.enc and .ash_history.
.ash_history record the way to encrypt, it uses openssl and the password is given.
So we also use openssl to decrypt it.
Save the enc to local.

$ icat -o 411648 disk.flag.img 1782 > flag.txt.enc

Then use openssl to decrypt.

$ openssl aes256 -d -salt -in flag.txt.
enc -out flag.txt -k unbreakablepassword1234567
*** WARNING : deprecated key derivation used.
Using -iter or -pbkdf2 would be better.
