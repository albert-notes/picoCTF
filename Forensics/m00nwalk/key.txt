Use qsstv to solve this problem.
Firstly, install qsstv by "apt-get install qsstv"
Then run "pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=virtual-cable"
Run "pavucontrol" to check if there's a null output.
Run qsstv and go to Options>Configuration>Sound and select PulseAudio.
Then back to pavucontrol, select Recording tab and check if the qsstv is caputured by null output.
And notice the hint "What is the CMU mascot?".
The answer is Scotty the Scottie Dog, so we should select Scottie 1 as qsstv's mode.
Run "paplay -d virtual-cable message.wav" to get the flag.
