Because there's something wrong on my edit, so I describe the way to break the challenge.
Use fls to see the disk's second linux system and enter the root file.
There's a ssh file and we can enter it to get the private key.
Store it in id_ed25519 and use the remote machine's command to get the flag.

$ sudo ssh -i id_ed25519 -p 63032 ctf-player@saturn.picoctf.net
