Run the command and get into the interface of psql.
type \? and see \l is to list databases.
but nothing in it.
In SQL we can get things from tables, so we use \d to list all the tables.

         List of relations
 Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner
--------+-------+-------+----------
 public | flags | table | postgres
(1 row)

There is a table named "flags", seems to be suspocious, use SQL expression to get the things in it.
SELECT * FROM flags;
 id | firstname | lastname  |                address
----+-----------+-----------+----------------------------------------
  1 | Luke      | Skywalker | picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_73b0678f}
  2 | Leia      | Organa    | Alderaan
  3 | Han       | Solo      | Corellia
(3 rows)
The flag is in it.
picoCTF{L3arN_S0m3_5qL_t0d4Y_73b0678f}
