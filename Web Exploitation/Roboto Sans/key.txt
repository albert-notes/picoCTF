As the title, see robots.txt.
There's three lines of strange characters.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg

"==" seems to be base64.
So take each line and base64 decode.

flag1.txtjs/myfi
js/myfile.txt
²û,².ðzè°..¡¡»/u«%z8

The second lines seems to be a right path, try it and you'll get the flag.
