As the title, it's a XPATH Injection Problem.
We can use the common payload of it to try.
Payload: ' or 1=1 or ' (Aiming to close the brackets)
And it shows green "You're on the right path."
Consequently, we can use the "starts-with()", which is a function to check the beginning of the decument.
We can use it to brute force the flag.
Additionally, "//*" will check all the documents, so it's also useful.
Create our fisrt payload: ' or //*[starts-with(text(),'pico')] or '
On the right path, so there must be a document have the flag.
We can write a python code to solve it. In sol.py.
Get the flag.
