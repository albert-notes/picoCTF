Same as the previous challenge, we check the .js and .wasm code.
The .js code inquired a file named "./qCCYI0ajpD", let's download it.
And it is obviously a .wasm file, so we use wasm-compile to turn it to c, more easy to solve.
wasm-decompile ../qCCYI0ajpD(Your may be different.)
Not every block is important, we check check_flag() and copy()
check_flag() seems to be the final check function, so the main processing function is copy()
You can find the e[2] is cycling by 5, so it might be the index of d_b="\xf1\xa7\xf0\x07\xed".
And the function named "copy", if directly use the d_a, there's no use to create the variables.
So it might be the input by user, after process then compare it to d_a.
Let's use python to brute for this for the flag, in sol.py.
Get the flag.
