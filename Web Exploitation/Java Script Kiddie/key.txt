This question need to input a squence of number to generate correct picture.
If input nothing, the picture won't appear.(PNG will break due to the header.)
Observe the .js file, our input is used to shift the index of selecting the bytes.
The bytes file is also in the website.
It's 16 numbers a cycle, so we can just check the png header.(16 bytes)
0x89,0x50,0x4e,0x47,0x0d,0x0a,0x1a,0x0a,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x0d,0x49,0x48,0x44,0x52
to get the right shift number.
We can write a code to brute force the number. In sol.py.(The logic is extremely easy. every 16 numbers a cycle.)
Get the flag in the QR code.
