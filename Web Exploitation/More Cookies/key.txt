Samely, we need to crack the cookie.
See the cookie "auth_name", it's like a base64, but after base64 decode, it is still encrypted.
Hint 1 is Homomorphic_encryption, it's a type of encryption.(Not needed.:P)
And we can find the content of description is quite different, CBC is obviously emphasized.
So we need to use CBC bit flip brute force to get the right cookie.
the python code is in the same folder and named sol.py.
Get the flag. (i,j)=(9,0).(MINE)
