The problem will test if the two files is the same, but content is different.
So let's use MD5 magic hash.
Select 2 different hashes in https://blog.csdn.net/qq_43613772/article/details/106223902
and put them in 2 pdfs.
echo -n "s878926199a" > f1.pdf
echo -n "s155964671a" > f2.pdf
and we get the flag eventually.
