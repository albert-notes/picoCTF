Rockstar again, but this time there's nothing in the output.
So we find another tool https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/rockstar-py.
Use it to get the python code and we can easily comprehend the code.

Rocknroll = True
Silence = False
a_guitar = 10
Tommy = 44
Music = 170
the_music = input()
if the_music == a_guitar:
    print("Keep on rocking!")
    the_rhythm = input()
    if the_rhythm - Music == False:
        Tommy = 66
        print(Tommy!)
        Music = 79
        Jamming = 78
        print(Music!)
        print(Jamming!)
        Tommy = 74
        print(Tommy!)
        They are dazzled audiences
        print(it!)
        Rock = 86
        print(it!)
        Tommy = 73
        print(it!)
        break
        print("Bring on the rock!")
        Else print("That ain't it, Chief")
        break

So the print is 66 79 78 74 79 86 73, use ascii decoder and get the flag.
